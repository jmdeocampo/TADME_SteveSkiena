6-2. Is the path between two vertices in a minimum spanning tree necessarily a shortest path between the two vertices in the full graph? Give a proof or a counterexample.

No.

Given a graph G(V,E,W) = ((A,B,C,D),({A,B},{B,C},{C,D},{D,A}),(1,2,3,2))

Minimum spanning tree has a weight of 6 with edges {A,B},{B,C},{C,D}.

In the full graph the minimum distance between A and D is 2.
