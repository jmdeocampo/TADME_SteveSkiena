6-3. Assume that all edges in the graph have distinct edge weights (i.e., no pair of edges have the same weight). Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree necessarily a shortest path between the two vertices in the full graph? Give a proof or a counterexample.

No.

Given a graph G(V,E,W) = ((A,B,C,D),({A,B},{B,C},{C,D},{D,A}),(1,2,3,4))

Minimum spanning tree has a weight of 6 with edges {A,B},{B,C},{C,D}.

The shortest path from A to D is 4.
