6-17. Either prove the following or give a counterexample:

(a) Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph necessarily the shortest (minimum weight) path?

(b) Suppose that the minimum spanning tree of the graph is unique. Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph necessarily the shortest (minimum weight) path?

  <p>

  (a) No. Shortest path is the lowest sum of all paths to a vertex. An edge between vertex A to vertex Z could be weight 20 while the minimum spanning tree sum could be 150 going through multiple vertices. ([See question 6-2](/Ch06_Answers/AnswersToQuestions/AQ_02_MinimumEdge.md)).

  (b) No. Same as (a).
