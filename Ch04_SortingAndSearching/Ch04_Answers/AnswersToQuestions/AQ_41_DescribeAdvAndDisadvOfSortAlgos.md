	Merge sort:

       * Advantages: suitable for linked list, suitable for external sort.  
       * Disadvantages: need extra buffer holding the merged data (but for linked-list)  

    Insertion/Selection sort:

       * Advantages: easy to implement.   
       * Disadvantages: too slow and become impractical when data is huge.

    Heap sort:

       * Advantages: don't need recursion. Suitable for large data.  
       * Disadvantages: usually slower than merge sort and quick sort.

    Quick sort:

       *Advantages: practical fastest.  
       *Disadvantages: recursive, worst case too slow.
