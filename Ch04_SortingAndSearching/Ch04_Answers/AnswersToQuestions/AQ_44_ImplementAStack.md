4-44. Design a stack that supports push, pop, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time. Can you do this?

	I think the actual question was about ability of building the stack that has push/pop/extract-min operations as in the queues - the extract removes element.This is impossible - that would give us an opportunity to sort in O(n) time (n O(1) push'es to the data structure, and then n extract-min's) --Kubek2k 05:00, 6 November 2011 (EST)
