  <p>

  A tree is an acyclic graph.
The simplest possible tree is one with 2 nodes *x*(root) and *y*. There is only one direction. 

Assuming there is a unique path between *x* and *y*, we add a new leaf *z* under *y*. *z* is only connection to its parent *y* so there is only one way from *z* to *x* that is *z*->*y*->*x*.
