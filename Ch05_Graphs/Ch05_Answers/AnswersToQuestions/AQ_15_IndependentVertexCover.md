5-15. A vertex cover of a graph G=(V,E) is a subset of vertices V′∈V such that every edge in E contains at least one vertex from V′. An independent set of graph G=(V,E) is a subset of vertices V′∈V such that no edge in E contains both vertices from V′. An independent vertex cover is a subset of vertices that is both an independent set and a vertex cover of G. Give an efficient algorithm for testing whether G contains an independent vertex cover. What classical graph problem does this reduce to?

  An independent set is a set of vertices where every two vertices do not share an edge. Each edge in the graph has at most one endpoint. This is a reduces to two-color graph problem.
