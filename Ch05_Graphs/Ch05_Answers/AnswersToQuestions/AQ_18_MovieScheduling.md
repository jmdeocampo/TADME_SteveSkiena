5-18. Consider a set of movies $M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_k$. There is a set of customers, each one of which indicates the two movies they would like to see this weekend. Movies are shown on Saturday evening and Sunday evening. Multiple movies may be screened at the same time. You must decide which movies should be televised on Saturday and which on Sunday, so that every customer gets to see the two movies they desire. Is there a schedule where each movie is shown at most once? Design an efficient algorithm to find such a schedule if one exists.

  <p>

  We have a set of Movies {M1, M2...Mk} and a set of Customers {C1, C2...Cp}. 

Each movie would be a node and for each customer would be an for the two movies they want to see. You are looking for a bipartite graph
