5-30. Suppose G is a connected undirected graph. An edge e whose removal disconnects the graph is called a bridge. Must every bridge e be an edge in a depth-first search tree of G? Give a proof or a counterexample.

  True. A DFS must visit all nodes in a connected graph. If the edge e is not in the connected graph then it will not be visited by DFS and could therefor not be a bridge that disconnects the graph.
