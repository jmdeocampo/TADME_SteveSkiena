5-8. Present correct and efficient algorithms to convert an undirected graph G between the following graph data structures. You must give the time complexity of each algorithm, assuming n vertices and m edges.

(a) Convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency lists.

(b) Convert from an adjacency list to an incidence matrix. 
  - An incidence matrix M has a row for each vertex and a column for each edge,
  - such that M[i,j]=1 if vertex i is part of edge j, otherwise M[i,j]=0.

(c) Convert from an incidence matrix to adjacency lists.
