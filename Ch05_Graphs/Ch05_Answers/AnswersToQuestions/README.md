5-1. For the following graphs G1 (left) and G2 (right): 
(see book for figure) 
(see book for figure)

(a) Report the order of the vertices encountered on a breadth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking the vertices in alphabetical order (i.e., A before Z).

(b) Report the order of the vertices encountered on a depth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking the vertices in alphabetical order (i.e., A before Z).
