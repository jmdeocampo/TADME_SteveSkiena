5-16. An independent set of an undirected graph G=(V,E) is a set of vertices $U $ such that no edge in E is incident on two vertices of U.

Give an efficient algorithm to find a maximum-size independent set if G is a tree.

Let G=(V,E) be a tree with weights associated with the vertices such that the weight of each vertex is equal to the degree of that vertex. Give an efficient algorithm to find a maximum independent set of G.

Let G=(V,E) be a tree with arbitrary weights associated with the vertices. Give an efficient algorithm to find a maximum independent set of G.

This translates to the question of labeling the tree with two colors, because this way each edge's vertices are colored differently. The larger group of colors is the sought for maximum-size independent set.
