5-22. Design a linear-time algorithm to eliminate each vertex v of degree 2 from a graph by replacing edges (u,v) and (v,w) by an edge (u,w). We also seek to eliminate multiple copies of edges by replacing them with a single edge. Note that removing multiple copies of an edge may create a new vertex of degree 2, which has to be removed, and that removing a vertex of degree 2 may create multiple edges, which also must be removed.
